Python GUI that takes in 3 equations and returns the best two to use for a system of equations and why.

To use compile the GUI.py file and the GUI should automatically pop up.

Type in 3 equations with th specifications (included in the GUI) and you'll get an answer from the sprite :)

This is just a demo so there are some edges that need to be debugged <3
